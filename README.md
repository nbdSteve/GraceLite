# GraceLite
GraceLite is a comprehensive and thorough greif prevention, grace plugin developed for Minecraft using the Spigot API. GraceLite is primarily design for the Factions gamemode, however, the plugins functionaility and support is not limited to this mode. The plugin supports any gamemode / server type.

#### What GraceLite Does:
For those unfamiliar, the purpose of a grace plugin is to stop things like tnt and creepers exploding. This is so there is a grace period for players to build the base before other players are able to raid it. GraceLite covers all of the explosion prevention bases, and also has an option to disable wither spawning - this can be persitent outside of the grace period.
